Rithm Setup
===========

An experimental attempt at making a Docker container for the Rithm student setup.

To try out::

  make rithm-setup    # need to do once
  make rithm          # starts container and drops you into it

  password: password

Ports 3000 and 3001 are forwarded from the container to the host.
